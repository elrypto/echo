## echo
Users can follow and mirror the trades of high performing market experts and match their portfolio trades and asset allocations.

## what is echo?
"echo" allows users to follow top performing portfolios (of token assets) and to match trades, and those top traders would be rewarded with token assets (for follows and trades matches). Essentially allowing users an open and transparent set of "indexes" that they can follow and match to allow them gain a lot of the benefits purported by crypto index funds. The fund management activities of which indexes to buy on a hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis is moved to the user in an accessible way. They can switch who they follow (or match trades from) or cash out into Eth at any time, and they don't have to be an accredited investor to get involved. It also gives traders a chance to gain notoriety and recognition in the community for their proven expertise and performance as well as earning tokens in proportion to their impact on the community.

## Origins - 0x hackathon (Feb 2019)
echo was a submission to the Feb 2019 [0x-hackathon](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-coinlist-hackathon-3b48ddbfd21c). echo allows the user to follow and mirror trades of top performing portfolios (collections of tokens with weighted allocations).
